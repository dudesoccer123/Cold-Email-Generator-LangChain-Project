# Cold-Email-Generator-LangChain-Project
This project uses LangChain, LLaMA 70B, and Groq to draft professional cold emails through a Streamlit interface. Users input a job link, and the LLaMA 70B model generates an email for the hiring manager. It leverages Chroma DB to dynamically add relevant portfolio links.
